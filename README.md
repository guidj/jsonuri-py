#JSONURI-PY
 
This package helps you convert Python dictionaries into an HTTP GET request parameters, and vice-versa


##Notes
The script was not designed to process HTML form data, specifically multi-value variables, i.e. from select attributes. Though if you convert the data to a JSON/JavaScript object, that should work.
